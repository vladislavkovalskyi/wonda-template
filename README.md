# Wonda bot template

**This template was made for [wonda](https://pypi.org/project/wonda/) version `0.6.9`**

**I hope this template will help a lot of people who are tired of creating the same project structure. I personally use it all the time.**

## ðŸ—‚ What dependencies are used in this template?
* [python](python.org) *(3.11 and above)*
* [wonda](https://pypi.org/project/wonda/) *(0.6.9) â€” the best framework for working with Telegram's Bot API*
* [tortoise-orm](https://pypi.org/project/tortoise-orm/) *(0.20.0) â€” simple asynchronous ORM for working with databases*
* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) *(1.7.1) â€” I highly recommend using this particular package manager*
